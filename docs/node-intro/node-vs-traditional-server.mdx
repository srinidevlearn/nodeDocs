## Comparison between Traditional Server and NodeJS

| Compared to traditional web-serving techniques where each connection (request) spawns a new thread, taking up system RAM and eventually maxing-out at the amount of RAM available                                                                          | Node.js operates on a singlethread, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections (held in the event loop). | 
| For Instance, we assuming that each thread potentially has an accompanying 2 MB of memory with it, running on a system with 8 GB of RAM puts us at a theoretical maximum of 4000 concurrent connections, plus the cost of context-switching between thread |                                               It achieves scalability levels of over 1M concurrent connections.                                                |
